abstract: Mobile developers tend to use source code obfuscation to protect their code
  against reverse engineering. Unfortunately, some developers rely on the idea that
  obfuscated applications also provide additional security. But that is not the case
  since mistakes in design are still present and can be used for arbitrary attacks.
  However, manually analyzing such obfuscated applications is time consuming for researchers
  due to the complexity of the generated code. Our debugging and manipulation tool
  (DAMN) offers a new way of investigating Android applications, including obfuscated
  ones. It combines static source code reversing with dynamic manipulation techniques
  to get rid of obfuscation penalties and supports the investigator during the analyzing
  process. DAMN can display the reversed source code, pause any application at any
  given time and allows to manipulate its state. All those features make DAMN a powerful
  reversing and analyzing tool for manual investigations of obfuscated Android applications.
