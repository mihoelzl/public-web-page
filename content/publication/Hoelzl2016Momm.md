abstract: There are many systems that provide users with an electronic identity (eID)
  to sign documents or authenticate to online services (e.g. governmental eIDs, OpenID).
  However, current solutions lack in providing proper techniques to use them as regular
  ID cards that digitally authenticate their holders to another physical person in
  the real world. We envision a fully mobile eID which provides such functionality
  in a privacy-preserving manner, fulfills requirements for governmental identities
  with high security demands (such as driving licenses, or passports) and can be used
  in the private domain (e.g. as loyalty cards). In this paper, we present potential
  use cases for such a flexible and privacy-preserving mobile eID and discuss the
  concept of privacy-preserving attribute queries. Furthermore, we formalize necessary
  functional, mobile, security, and privacy requirements, and present a brief overview
  of potential techniques to cover all of them.
