abstract: 'The digital compass on mobile devices plays an important role in the mobile
  computing domain where applications have to rely on the accuracy of this sensor.
  In this paper we investigate the difficulties that occur with a digital compass
  in an industrial environment especially concerning indoor localization systems using
  the digital compass in mobile devices. We focus on two dependencies of the accuracy
  of this sensor type: device and location.'
