abstract: The usage of security and privacy sensitive systems on mobile devices, such
  as mobile banking, mobile credit cards, mobile ticketing, or mobile digital identities,
  has continuously risen in recent years. This development makes the protection of
  personal and security sensitive data on mobile devices more important than ever.
  A common approach for the protection of sensitive data is to use additional hardware
  such as smart cards or secure elements. The communication between such dedicated
  hardware and back-end management systems uses strong cryptography. However, the
  data transfer between applications on the mobile device and so-called applets on
  the dedicated hardware is often either unencrypted (and interceptable by malicious
  software) or encrypted with static keys stored in applications. To address this
  issue we present a solution for fine-grained secure application-to-applet communication
  based on Secure Remote Password (SRP-6a and SRP-5), an authenticated key agreement
  protocol, with a user-provided password at run-time. By exploiting the Java Card
  cryptographic APIs and minor adaptations to the protocol, which do not affect the
  security, we are able to implement this scheme on Java Cards with reasonable computation
  time.
