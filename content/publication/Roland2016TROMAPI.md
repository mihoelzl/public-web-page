abstract: This report gives an overview of secure element integration into Android
  devices. It focuses on the Open Mobile API as an open interface to access secure
  elements from Android applications. The overall architecture of the Open Mobile
  API is described and current Android devices are analyzed with regard to the availability
  of this API. Moreover, this report summarizes our efforts of reverse engineering
  the stock ROM of a Samsung Galaxy S3 in order to analyze the integration of the
  Open Mobile API and the interface that is used to perform APDU-based communication
  with the UICC (Universal Integrated Circuit Card). It further provides a detailed
  explanation on how to integrate this functionality into CyanogenMod (an after-market
  firmware for Android devices).
