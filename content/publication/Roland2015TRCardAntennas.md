abstract: This report summarizes the results of our evaluation of antennas of contactless
  and dual interface smartcards and our ideas for user-switchable NFC antennas. We
  show how to disassemble smartcards with contactless capabilities in order to obtain
  the bare chip module and the bare antenna wire. We examine the design of various
  smartcard antennas and present concepts to render the contactless interface unusable.
  Finally, we present ideas and practical experiments to make the contactless interface
  switchable by the end-user.
