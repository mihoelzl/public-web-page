abstract: Insuffcient security and privacy level on mobile devices, have made it diffcult
  to utilize sensitive systems like mobile banking, mobile credit cards, mobile ticketing
  or mobile passports. Solving these challenges in security and privacy, could provide
  a potential future for such systems towards better mobility and higher confidence
  level of end-user services. We address this issue by introducing an open ecosystem
  for mobile applications on tamper resistant hardware. A transparent integration
  of security features of such hardware will allow security critical applications
  to securely store and read data, transfer data to servers and securely communicate
  with other hardware parts (e.g. touch screen, sensors, etc.). In this research we
  will investigate variants and analyse trade-offs of integrating such an interface.
