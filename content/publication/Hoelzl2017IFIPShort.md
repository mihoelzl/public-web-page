abstract: There is a broad range of existing electronic identity (eID) systems which
  provide methods to sign documents or authenticate to online services (e.g. governmental
  eIDs, FIDO). However, these solutions mainly focus on the validation of an identity
  to a backend infrastructure. That is, they lack in providing proper techniques to
  use them as regular ID cards to digitally authenticate an eID holder to another
  physical person in the real world. We envision a mobile eID which provides such
  a functionality and enables extensibility for its use with numerous different public
  and private services (e.g. for loyalty programs, public transport tickets, students
  cards), while protecting the privacy of the eID holder. In this paper, we present
  a general architecture for such a privacy-preserving mobile eID that allows identity
  validation in a similar fashion as regular ID cards and makes carrying around various
  physical cards unnecessary.
