abstract: "Providing methods to anonymously validate the user\u2019s identity is essential\
  \ in many applications of electronic identity (eID) systems. A feasible approach\
  \ to realize such a privacy-preserving eID is the usage of group signature protocols\
  \ or pseudonym-based signatures. However, providing a revocation mechanism that\
  \ preserves privacy is often the bottleneck for the scalability of such schemes.\
  \ In order to bridge this gap between practicability and privacy, we propose a scalable\
  \ and efficient revocation scheme suitable for smart cards in a mobile eID architecture.\
  \ By using a pseudo-random function, we derive one-time revocation tokens for the\
  \ revocation check and generate proofs of validity using a new method referred to\
  \ as disposable dynamic accumulators. Our scheme thereby preserves unlinkability\
  \ and anonymity of the eID holder even beyond revocation and does not require online\
  \ connectivity to a trusted party for the verification and revocation check."
