abstract: Biometrics have become important for authentication on mobile devices, e.g.
  to unlock devices before using them. One way to protect biometric information stored
  on mobile devices from disclosure is using embedded smart cards (SCs) with biometric
  match-on-card (MOC) approaches. Computational restrictions of SCs thereby also limit
  biometric matching procedures. We present a mobile MOC approach that uses offline
  training to obtain authentication models with a simplistic internal representation
  in the final trained state, whereat we adapt features and model representation to
  enable their usage on SCs. The obtained model is used within SCs on mobile devices
  without requiring retraining when enrolling individual users. We apply our approach
  to acceleration based mobile gait authentication, using a 16 bit integer range Java
  Card, and evaluate authentication performance and computation time on the SC using
  a publicly available dataset. Results indicate that our approach is feasible with
  an equal error rate of 12 and a computation time below 2s on the SC, including data
  transmissions and computations. To the best of our knowledge, this thereby represents
  the first practically feasible approach towards acceleration based gait match-on-card
  authentication.
