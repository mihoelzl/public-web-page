abstract: Traditional authentication methods (e.g. password, PIN) often do not scale
  well to the context of mobile devices in terms of security and usability. However,
  the adoption of Near Field Communication (NFC) on a broad range of smartphones enables
  the use of NFC-enabled tokens as an additional authentication factor. This additional
  factor can help to improve the security as well as usability on mobile apps. In
  this paper we evaluate the use of different types of existing NFC tags as tokens
  for establishing authenticated secure sessions between smartphone apps and web services.
  Based on this evaluation, we present two concepts for a user-friendly secure authentication
  mechanism for mobile apps, the Protecting Touch (PT) architectures. These two architectures
  are designed to be implemented with either end of the spectrum of cheap and widely-available
  NFC tags while maintaining a reasonable trade-off between security, availability,
  and cost.
