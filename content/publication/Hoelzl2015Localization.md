abstract: While indoor localization has become a highly growing application domain
  in the last few years, it is hardly investigated in industrial environments. Interferences
  of magnetic fields, shadowing and multi-path propagation discourages positioning
  system vendors to port their techniques to these harsh environments. However, the
  actual influence of these interferences to the positioning accuracy and the differences
  between an industrial an non-industrial environment has never been evaluated. This
  paper analyzes the actual differences for a positioning technique that is based
  on Wi-Fi fingerprinting, map matching, dead reckoning, filtering and a plausibility
  determination. An investigation of the Wi-Fi signal strengths and compass sensor
  values in an industrial and a non-industrial environment thereby showed that the
  differences between them are significant. In fact, they show that more interferences
  and shadowing in the industrial environment resulted in even more accurate positioning.
