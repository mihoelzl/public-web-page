abstract: 'The penetration rate of smart phones is increasing rapidly and therefore
  these mobile devices become more and more dominating in daily life. Within an extremely
  short period of time the way of communication, reading books, listening music, viewing
  images e.g. has changed dramatically. For elderly people definitively too little
  time to adapt to this new type of interaction paradigm accordingly. But the number
  of senior people is growing worldwide and therefore the user experience of these
  mobile devices has to be adapted to the needs of the elderly. In this paper we introduce
  a touch screen based UI concept for senior users. This concept is based on two different
  interface layers: the integrated scalable help system and the book-oriented application
  design which uses the metaphor of books for menu selection and a flat navigation
  tree for reducing short-term memory load.'
