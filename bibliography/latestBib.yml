  abstract: Insuffcient security and privacy level on mobile devices, have made it
    diffcult to utilize sensitive systems like mobile banking, mobile credit cards,
    mobile ticketing or mobile passports. Solving these challenges in security and
    privacy, could provide a potential future for such systems towards better mobility
    and higher confidence level of end-user services. We address this issue by introducing
    an open ecosystem for mobile applications on tamper resistant hardware. A transparent
    integration of security features of such hardware will allow security critical
    applications to securely store and read data, transfer data to servers and securely
    communicate with other hardware parts (e.g. touch screen, sensors, etc.). In this
    research we will investigate variants and analyse trade-offs of integrating such
    an interface.

  abstract: Insufficient security and privacy on mobile devices have made it difficult
    to utilize sensitive systems like mobile banking, mobile credit cards, mobile
    ticketing or mobile passports. Solving these challenges in security and privacy,
    could result in better mobility and a higher level of confidence for the end-user
    services in such systems. Our approach for a higher security and privacy level
    on mobile devices introduces an open ecosystem for tamper resistant hardware.
    Big advantages of these modules are the protection against unauthorized access
    and the on-device cryptographic operations they can perform. In this paper, we
    analyse the requirements and performance restrictions of these hardware modules
    and present an interface concept for a tight integration of their security features.

  abstract: 'The penetration rate of smart phones is increasing rapidly and therefore
    these mobile devices become more and more dominating in daily life. Within an
    extremely short period of time the way of communication, reading books, listening
    music, viewing images e.g. has changed dramatically. For elderly people definitively
    too little time to adapt to this new type of interaction paradigm accordingly.
    But the number of senior people is growing worldwide and therefore the user experience
    of these mobile devices has to be adapted to the needs of the elderly. In this
    paper we introduce a touch screen based UI concept for senior users. This concept
    is based on two different interface layers: the integrated scalable help system
    and the book-oriented application design which uses the metaphor of books for
    menu selection and a flat navigation tree for reducing short-term memory load.'

  abstract: With the increasing popularity of security and privacy sensitive systems
    on mobile devices, such as mobile banking, mobile credit cards, mobile ticketing,
    or mobile digital identities, challenges for the protection of personal and security
    sensitive data of these use cases emerged. A common approach for the protection
    of sensitive data is to use additional hardware such as smart cards or secure
    elements. The communication between such dedicated hardware and back-end management
    systems uses strong cryptography. However, the data transfer between applications
    on the mobile device and so-called applets on the dedicated hardware is often
    either unencrypted (and interceptable by malicious software) or encrypted with
    static keys stored in applications. To address this issue we present a solution
    for fine-grained secure application-to-applet communication based on Secure Remote
    Password (SRP-6a), an authenticated key agreement protocol, with a user-provided
    password at run-time. By exploiting the Java Card cryptographic API and minor
    adaptations to the protocol, which do not affect the security, we were able to
    implement this scheme on Java Cards with reasonable computation time.

  abstract: 'Current efforts to increase the security of the boot sequence for mobile
    devices fall into two main categories: (i) secure boot: where each stage in the
    boot sequence is evaluated, aborting the boot process if a non expected component
    attempts to be loaded; and (ii) trusted boot: where a log is maintained with the
    components that have been loaded in the boot process for later audit. The first
    approach is often criticized for locking down devices, thus reducing users’ freedom
    to choose software. The second lacks the mechanisms to enforce any form of run-time
    verification. In this paper, we present the architecture for a two-phase boot
    verification that addresses these shortcomings. In the first phase, at boot-time
    the integrity of the bootloader and OS images are verified and logged; in the
    second phase, at run-time applications can check the boot traces and verify that
    the running software satisfies their security requirements. This is a first step
    towards supporting usage control primitives for running applications. Our approach
    relies on off-the-shelf secure hardware that is available in a multitude of mobile
    devices: ARM TrustZone as a Trusted Execution Environment, and Secure Element
    as a tamper-resistant unit.'

  abstract: While indoor localization has become a highly growing application domain
    in the last few years, it is hardly investigated in industrial environments. Interferences
    of magnetic fields, shadowing and multi-path propagation discourages positioning
    system vendors to port their techniques to these harsh environments. However,
    the actual influence of these interferences to the positioning accuracy and the
    differences between an industrial an non-industrial environment has never been
    evaluated. This paper analyzes the actual differences for a positioning technique
    that is based on Wi-Fi fingerprinting, map matching, dead reckoning, filtering
    and a plausibility determination. An investigation of the Wi-Fi signal strengths
    and compass sensor values in an industrial and a non-industrial environment thereby
    showed that the differences between them are significant. In fact, they show that
    more interferences and shadowing in the industrial environment resulted in even
    more accurate positioning.

  abstract: The usage of security and privacy sensitive systems on mobile devices,
    such as mobile banking, mobile credit cards, mobile ticketing, or mobile digital
    identities, has continuously risen in recent years. This development makes the
    protection of personal and security sensitive data on mobile devices more important
    than ever. A common approach for the protection of sensitive data is to use additional

  abstract: There are many systems that provide users with an electronic identity
    (eID) to sign documents or authenticate to online services (e.g. governmental
    eIDs, OpenID). However, current solutions lack in providing proper techniques
    to use them as regular ID cards that digitally authenticate their holders to another
    physical person in the real world. We envision a fully mobile eID which provides
    such functionality in a privacy-preserving manner, fulfills requirements for governmental
    identities with high security demands (such as driving licenses, or passports)
    and can be used in the private domain (e.g. as loyalty cards). In this paper,
    we present potential use cases for such a flexible and privacy-preserving mobile
    eID and discuss the concept of privacy-preserving attribute queries. Furthermore,
    we formalize necessary functional, mobile, security, and privacy requirements,
    and present a brief overview of potential techniques to cover all of them.

  abstract: Mobile developers tend to use source code obfuscation to protect their
    code against reverse engineering. Unfortunately, some developers rely on the idea
    that obfuscated applications also provide additional security. But that is not
    the case since mistakes in design are still present and can be used for arbitrary
    attacks. However, manually analyzing such obfuscated applications is time consuming
    for researchers due to the complexity of the generated code. Our debugging and
    manipulation tool (DAMN) offers a new way of investigating Android applications,
    including obfuscated ones. It combines static source code reversing with dynamic
    manipulation techniques to get rid of obfuscation penalties and supports the investigator
    during the analyzing process. DAMN can display the reversed source code, pause
    any application at any given time and allows to manipulate its state. All those
    features make DAMN a powerful reversing and analyzing tool for manual investigations
    of obfuscated Android applications.

  abstract: Biometrics have become important for authentication on mobile devices,
    e.g. to unlock devices before using them. One way to protect biometric information
    stored on mobile devices from disclosure is using embedded smart cards (SCs) with
    biometric match-on-card (MOC) approaches. Computational restrictions of SCs thereby
    also limit biometric matching procedures. We present a mobile MOC approach that
    uses offline training to obtain authentication models with a simplistic internal
    representation in the final trained state, whereat we adapt features and model
    representation to enable their usage on SCs. The obtained model is used within
    SCs on mobile devices without requiring retraining when enrolling individual users.
    We apply our approach to acceleration based mobile gait authentication, using
    a 16 bit integer range Java Card, and evaluate authentication performance and
    computation time on the SC using a publicly available dataset. Results indicate
    that our approach is feasible with an equal error rate of 12 and a computation
    time below 2s on the SC, including data transmissions and computations. To the
    best of our knowledge, this thereby represents the first practically feasible
    approach towards acceleration based gait match-on-card authentication.

    to acceleration based mobile gait authentication as well as face authentication
    and compare authentication accuracy and computation time of 16 and 32 bit Java
    Card SCs. Using 16 instead of 32 bit SCs has little impact on authentication performance
    and is faster due to less data transfer and computations on the SC. Results indicate
    11.4 and 2.4-5.4 EER for gait respectively face authentication, with transmission
    and computation durations on SCs in the range of 2s respectively 1s. To the best
    of our knowledge this work represents the first practical approach towards acceleration
    based gait MOC authentication.

  note: In press
  abstract: Providing methods to anonymously validate the user’s identity is essential
    in many applications of electronic identity (eID) systems. A feasible approach
    to realize such a privacy-preserving eID is the usage of group signature protocols
    or pseudonym-based signatures. However, providing a revocation mechanism that
    preserves privacy is often the bottleneck for the scalability of such schemes.
    In order to bridge this gap between practicability and privacy, we propose a scalable
    and efficient revocation scheme suitable for smart cards in a mobile eID architecture.
    By using a pseudo-random function, we derive one-time revocation tokens for the
    revocation check and generate proofs of validity using a new method referred to
    as disposable dynamic accumulators. Our scheme thereby preserves unlinkability
    and anonymity of the eID holder even beyond revocation and does not require online
    connectivity to a trusted party for the verification and revocation check.

  abstract: Traditional authentication methods (e.g. password, PIN) often do not scale
    well to the context of mobile devices in terms of security and usability. However,
    the adoption of Near Field Communication (NFC) on a broad range of smartphones
    enables the use of NFC-enabled tokens as an additional authentication factor.
    This additional factor can help to improve the security as well as usability on
    mobile apps. In this paper we evaluate the use of different types of existing
    NFC tags as tokens for establishing authenticated secure sessions between smartphone
    apps and web services. Based on this evaluation, we present two concepts for a
    user-friendly secure authentication mechanism for mobile apps, the Protecting
    Touch (PT) architectures. These two architectures are designed to be implemented
    with either end of the spectrum of cheap and widely-available NFC tags while maintaining
    a reasonable trade-off between security, availability, and cost.
