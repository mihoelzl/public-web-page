abstract: Insufficient security and privacy on mobile devices have made it difficult
  to utilize sensitive systems like mobile banking, mobile credit cards, mobile ticketing
  or mobile passports. Solving these challenges in security and privacy, could result
  in better mobility and a higher level of confidence for the end-user services in
  such systems. Our approach for a higher security and privacy level on mobile devices
  introduces an open ecosystem for tamper resistant hardware. Big advantages of these
  modules are the protection against unauthorized access and the on-device cryptographic
  operations they can perform. In this paper, we analyse the requirements and performance
  restrictions of these hardware modules and present an interface concept for a tight
  integration of their security features.
