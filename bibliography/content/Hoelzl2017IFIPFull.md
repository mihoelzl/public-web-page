abstract: There is a broad range of existing electronic identity (eID) systems which
  provide methods to sign documents or authenticate to online services (e.g. governmental
  eIDs, FIDO). However, these solutions mainly focus on the validation of an identity
  to a web page. That is, they often miss proper techniques to use them as regular
  ID cards to digitally authenticate an eID holder to another physical person in the
  real world. We propose a mobile eID which provides such a functionality and enables
  extensibility for its use with numerous different public and private services (e.g.
  for loyalty programs, public transport tickets, student cards), while protecting
  the privacy of the eID holder. In this paper, we present a general architecture
  and efficient protocols for such a privacy-preserving mobile eID that allows identity
  validation in a similar fashion as regular ID cards and makes carrying around various
  physical cards unnecessary.
