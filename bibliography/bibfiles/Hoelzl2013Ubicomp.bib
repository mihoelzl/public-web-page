    Abstract = "Insuffcient security and privacy level on mobile devices, have made it diffcult to utilize sensitive systems like mobile banking, mobile credit cards, mobile ticketing or mobile passports. Solving these challenges in security and privacy, could provide a potential future for such systems towards better mobility and higher confidence level of end-user services. We address this issue by introducing an open ecosystem for mobile applications on tamper resistant hardware. A transparent integration of security features of such hardware will allow security critical applications to securely store and read data, transfer data to servers and securely communicate with other hardware parts (e.g. touch screen, sensors, etc.). In this research we will investigate variants and analyse trade-offs of integrating such an interface.",
