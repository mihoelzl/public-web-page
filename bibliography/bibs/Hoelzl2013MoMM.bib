    abstract = "Insufficient security and privacy on mobile devices have made it difficult to utilize sensitive systems like mobile banking, mobile credit cards, mobile ticketing or mobile passports. Solving these challenges in security and privacy, could result in better mobility and a higher level of confidence for the end-user services in such systems. Our approach for a higher security and privacy level on mobile devices introduces an open ecosystem for tamper resistant hardware. Big advantages of these modules are the protection against unauthorized access and the on-device cryptographic operations they can perform. In this paper, we analyse the requirements and performance restrictions of these hardware modules and present an interface concept for a tight integration of their security features.",
