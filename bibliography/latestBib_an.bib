  Abstract                 = {Insuffcient security and privacy level on mobile devices, have made it diffcult to utilize sensitive systems like mobile banking, mobile credit cards, mobile ticketing or mobile passports. Solving these challenges in security and privacy, could provide a potential future for such systems towards better mobility and higher confidence level of end-user services. We address this issue by introducing an open ecosystem for mobile applications on tamper resistant hardware. A transparent integration of security features of such hardware will allow security critical applications to securely store and read data, transfer data to servers and securely communicate with other hardware parts (e.g. touch screen, sensors, etc.). In this research we will investigate variants and analyse trade-offs of integrating such an interface.},

Big advantages of these modules are the protection against unauthorized access and the on-device cryptographic operations they can perform. In this paper, we analyse the requirements and performance restrictions of these hardware modules and present an interface concept for a tight integration of their security features.},

Within an extremely short period of time the way of communication, reading books, listening music, viewing images e.g. has changed dramatically. For elderly people definitively too little time to adapt to this new type of interaction paradigm accordingly.  But the number of senior people is growing worldwide and therefore the user experience of these mobile devices has to be adapted to the needs of the elderly. In this paper we introduce a touch screen based UI concept for senior users. This concept is based on two different interface layers: the integrated scalable help system and the book-oriented application design which uses the metaphor of books for menu selection and a flat navigation tree for reducing short-term memory load.},

  abstract ={With the increasing popularity of security and privacy sensitive systems on mobile devices, such as mobile banking, mobile credit cards, mobile ticketing, or mobile digital identities, challenges  for the protection of personal and security sensitive data of these use cases emerged. A common approach for the protection of sensitive data is to use additional hardware such as smart cards or secure elements. The communication between such dedicated hardware and back-end management systems uses strong cryptography. However, the data transfer between applications on the mobile device and so-called applets on the dedicated hardware is often either unencrypted (and interceptable by malicious software) or encrypted with static keys stored in applications. To address this issue we present a solution for fine-grained secure application-to-applet communication based on Secure Remote Password (SRP-6a), an authenticated key agreement protocol, with a user-provided password at run-time. By exploiting the Java Card cryptographic API and minor adaptations to the protocol, which do not affect the security, we were able to implement this scheme on Java Cards with reasonable computation time.},

  abstract = {Current efforts to increase the security of the boot sequence for mobile devices fall into two main categories: (i) secure boot: where each stage in the boot sequence is evaluated, aborting the boot process if a non expected component attempts to be loaded; and (ii) trusted boot: where a log is maintained with the components that have been loaded in the boot process for later audit. The first approach is often criticized for locking down devices, thus reducing users' freedom to choose software. The second lacks the mechanisms to enforce any form of run-time verification. In this paper, we present the architecture for a two-phase boot verification that addresses these shortcomings. In the first phase, at boot-time the integrity of the bootloader and OS images are verified and logged; in the second phase, at run-time applications can check the boot traces and verify that the running software satisfies their security requirements. This is a first step towards supporting usage control primitives for running applications. Our approach relies on off-the-shelf secure hardware that is available in a multitude of mobile devices: ARM TrustZone as a Trusted Execution Environment, and Secure Element as a tamper-resistant unit.},

Interferences of magnetic fields, shadowing and multi-path propagation discourages positioning system vendors to port their techniques to these harsh environments. However, the actual influence of these interferences to the positioning accuracy and the differences between an industrial an non-industrial environment has never been evaluated. This paper analyzes the actual differences for a positioning technique that is based on Wi-Fi fingerprinting, map matching, dead reckoning, filtering and a plausibility determination. An investigation of the Wi-Fi signal strengths and compass sensor values in an industrial and a non-industrial environment thereby showed that the differences between them are significant. In fact, they show that more interferences and shadowing in the industrial environment resulted in even more accurate positioning.},

We envision a fully mobile eID which provides such functionality in a privacy-preserving manner, fulfills requirements for governmental identities with high security demands (such as driving licenses, or passports) and can be used in the private domain (e.g. as loyalty cards). In this paper, we present potential use cases for such a flexible and privacy-preserving mobile eID and discuss the concept of privacy-preserving attribute queries. Furthermore, we formalize necessary functional, mobile, security, and privacy requirements, and present a brief overview of potential techniques to cover all of them.},

But that is not the case since mistakes in design are still present and can be used for arbitrary attacks. However, manually analyzing such obfuscated applications is time consuming for researchers due to the complexity of the generated code. 
  Our debugging and manipulation tool (DAMN) offers a new way of investigating Android applications, including obfuscated ones. It combines static source code reversing with dynamic manipulation techniques to get rid of obfuscation penalties and supports the investigator during the analyzing process. DAMN can display the reversed source code, pause any application at any given time and allows to manipulate its state. All those features make DAMN a powerful reversing and analyzing tool for manual investigations of obfuscated Android applications.},

We present a mobile MOC approach that uses offline training to obtain authentication models with a simplistic internal representation in the final trained state, whereat we adapt features and model representation to enable their usage on SCs. The obtained model is used within SCs on mobile devices without requiring retraining when enrolling individual users. We apply our approach to acceleration based mobile gait authentication, using a 16 bit integer range Java Card, and evaluate authentication performance and computation time on the SC using a publicly available dataset. Results indicate that our approach is feasible with an equal error rate of 12 and a computation time below 2s on the SC, including data transmissions and computations. To the best of our knowledge, this thereby represents the first practically feasible approach towards acceleration based gait match-on-card authentication.},

Using 16 instead of 32 bit SCs has little impact on authentication performance and is faster due to less data transfer and computations on the SC.

A feasible approach to realize such a privacy-preserving eID is the usage of group signature protocols or pseudonym-based signatures. However, providing a revocation mechanism that preserves privacy is often the bottleneck for the scalability of such schemes. In order to bridge this gap between practicability and privacy, we propose a scalable and efficient revocation scheme suitable for smart cards in a mobile eID architecture. By using a pseudo-random function, we derive one-time revocation tokens for the revocation check and generate proofs of validity using a new method referred to as disposable dynamic accumulators. Our scheme thereby preserves  unlinkability and anonymity of the eID holder even beyond revocation and does not require online connectivity to a trusted party for the verification and revocation check. },

This additional factor can help to improve the security as well as usability on mobile apps.

Based on this evaluation, we present two concepts for a user-friendly secure authentication mechanism for mobile apps, the Protecting Touch (PT) architectures.
