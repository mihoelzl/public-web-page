    abstract = "The digital compass on mobile devices plays an important role in the mobile computing domain where applications have to rely on the accuracy of this sensor. In this paper we investigate the difficulties that occur with a digital compass in an industrial environment especially concerning indoor localization systems using the digital compass in mobile devices. We focus on two dependencies of the accuracy of this sensor type: device and location.",
